Tiêu đề bài viết: Những câu chuyện Đức Phật kể qua lời Lư Đài Trưởng : XIN TIỀN ĐỨC PHẬT Nội dung chi tiết: The prince at that time was my previous life; the minister's son was the elder Sudatta; and the gambler was none other than the Brahman who blocked the road and demanded the gold! Therefore, anyone who is in debt must repay it; otherwise, even if you practice and become a Buddha, you will still not be able to escape this difficulty!" "Even if the karma you have created does not disappear over hundreds and thousands of kalpas, when the cause and conditions meet, you will still have to bear the consequences." Everything in this life is the result of karma from the previous life. Practice is inseparable from cause and effect. As the cause, so the result. All the consequences are borne by oneself, and no one can replace them. Understanding this principle, we should be more cautious in the cause, stop doing evil and do good.
